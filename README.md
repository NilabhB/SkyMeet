SkyMeet uses Google Firebase for User-ID authentication and Firestore as a Database for storing User's data (Name and Email currently) without compromising security protocols and the integration of video conferencing room is based upon the Open Source Jitsi Multiplatform. Although we have provided a Guest Mode, where no user's data is required.

SkyMeet will easily handle 30 to 35 participants without any glitch, however it's maximum participants in one room is 100 (not tested yet). SkyMeet offers multiple features like chat and poll section, screen sharing, attending meeting in low bandwidth, stream video and many more. Meeting Room is fully encrypted and completely secure along with other customizable security features.

We are planning to introduce more features in the coming days.

**Creating your own SkyMeet:**
<br />
<br />
I welcome all developers to use the source code & create applications like this one. There are several things I require from **all developers** for the moment.
* Please **do not** use the name SkyMeet for your app — or make sure your users understand that it is unethical and unofficial.
* Please **do not** use the standard SkyMeet logo as your app's logo.
* Please **study** the terms & conditions
* Please remember to publish **your** code too in order to comply with the licences.
